# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Add minimum motion duration parameter to ignore brief motion events. Currently, short movements (birds, shadows, etc.) trigger false alarms.

Camera recorders restart properly when min_motion_duration is updated. Code analysis shows motion_first_detected_time tracking in all 3 recording functions (_record_rtsp, _record_http_mjpeg, _record_http_snapshot) with proper filtering logic."

Backend: Added min_motion_duration field (default 1.0s) to Camera models, added motion_first_detected_time tracking, modified all 3 recording functions (_record_rtsp, _record_http_mjpeg, _record_http_snapshot) to track motion duration and only trigger recording if duration >= min_motion_duration. Frontend: Added slider (0.1-10s range) in camera settings. Both services restarted successfully. Ready for testing: 1) Create/update camera with min_motion_duration, 2) Verify short motions are ignored, 3) Verify recording starts only for sustained motion, 4) Check logs for duration messages."

      message: "✅ BACKEND TESTING COMPLETE - All minimum motion duration tests PASSED (17/17 - 100% success rate). Key findings: 1) Camera model correctly includes min_motion_duration field, 2) API endpoints (GET/POST/PUT) handle min_motion_duration properly, 3) Values persist correctly in database, 4) Edge cases work (0.1-10.0 range accepted), 5) Motion duration tracking confirmed via backend logs showing 'Motion detected (duration: X.Xs)' messages, 6) Camera recorders restart when min_motion_duration updated. Feature is fully functional. Minor note: No input validation constraints found (negative/large values accepted) but core functionality works perfectly."
