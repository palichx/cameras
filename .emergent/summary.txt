The AI engineer has significantly evolved the video surveillance application from an MVP, addressing numerous functional, performance, and UI challenges. Key achievements include resolving critical deployment issues like Kubernetes ingress white screen errors and localizing external scripts. Core features such as advanced MOG2 motion detection, Telegram integration for notifications and accelerated videos, and H.264 conversion were implemented. The engineer then focused on mass management UI for recordings and motion events, followed by enhancing the video player's error handling. Major efforts were directed towards debugging and stabilizing the Telegram bot, fixing persistent  and  misconfigurations, and optimizing CPU utilization by addressing Uvicorn's  mode and refining video processing logic. The pre/post-recording logic was refined to prevent video segment loss. Currently, the engineer is optimizing video streaming to reuse existing camera connections when opening live views in new windows, reducing redundant CPU load.

<product_requirements>
The goal is a comprehensive web-based video surveillance system supporting RTSP/HTTP cameras, continuous and motion-triggered recording with configurable settings, and scalability for over 10 cameras. The system is Dockerized with FastAPI/React, Nginx, and Kubernetes. The UI enables camera management, viewing recordings (H.264 playback), live stream controls, and system settings (FFmpeg, Telegram bot). Recent feature additions include Telegram integration (640x480, 5 FPS, 5x accelerated video, notifications on motion) and improved MOG2 motion detection (configurable parameters). Upcoming functionality includes mass management for recordings and motion events (delete multiple, by date, by camera). The application's core is functional, with significant bug fixes in deployment, UI, video processing, and initial backend API for mass management completed. The Telegram bot and CPU utilization have also been major areas of recent focus.

<pending_tasks>
- **Backend:** None, all requested backend logic appears to be implemented.
- **Frontend:** Verify the fix for reusing camera streams when opening in a new window.
- **Telegram Bot:** Test the Telegram bot with a *valid* token and chat ID to confirm full end-to-end functionality including combined video sending.
- **FFmpeg:** Install  system-wide to enable H.264 video conversion and proper playback in browsers.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a performance issue where opening a camera's live stream in a new browser window caused a redundant connection to the camera, effectively doubling the load. The user explicitly requested to fix this, stating: в отдельном окне камера открывается долго. не надо подключаться к камере еще раз. необходимо использовать тот же самый стрим, что на основной странице.

To resolve this, the AI engineer modified  to reuse existing  instances for live streams, including those opened in separate windows. This means the backend will now share the frames being captured by an already active  instance, instead of initializing a new  object for each client.

The engineer applied the code changes (Message 584: ) and is in the process of restarting the backend services to apply these changes. This is the very last action recorded in the trajectory.

<optional_next_step>
Restart the backend to apply the changes for reusing the camera stream for new windows, then verify the fix.
